## Usage

### Drafts and Articles

Each draft is a Markdown file (`.md`) that contains the content of the article. These drafts can be edited and previewed before publishing on Medium.

### HTML Tables

Tables are crafted in HTML for better formatting and integration within the articles. You can find these tables in the `tables/` directory.

### Summaries and References

Summaries of tables and additional references are provided in the `summaries/` and `references/` directories, respectively. These files help in understanding the context and provide additional insights.

### CSS Stylesheets

Custom CSS stylesheets are included in the `css/` directory to enhance the appearance of the articles. You can modify these stylesheets to fit the visual style of your content.

### Commands

Special commands like `tablethis`, `sumTable`, and `refthis` are documented in the `commands/` directory. These commands help in automating the embedding and formatting processes.
